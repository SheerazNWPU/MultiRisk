## Generating Risk Features Using Decision Tree Rules

### Steps:

1. Navigate to the `tree_2_rules` folder.
2. Open the `decision_tree_2_rules.py` file.
3. Edit the paths at the end of the file to match your dataset and output locations.
4. Once the paths are set, run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python decision_tree_2_rules.py
   ```

This will generate the risk features in the form of rules.
